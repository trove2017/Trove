# Trove
Cancer hallmarks, a concept that seeks to explain the complexity of cancer initiation and development, provide a new perspective of studying cancer signaling which could lead to a greater understanding of this complex disease. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently a lack of tools that support such hallmark-based study of the cancer signaling network, thereby impeding the gain of knowledge in this area. TROVE is a user-friendly and novel software that facilitates hallmark annotation, visualization and analysis in cancer signaling networks. It can be used to build further network-based analytics applications for cancer.
